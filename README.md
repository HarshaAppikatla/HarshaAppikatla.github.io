## 👨‍💻 About This Repository

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website. I built this from scratch to not only showcase my projects but to demonstrate my ability to design **clean, responsive, and performance-first** web experiences without relying on heavy frameworks.

This isn't just a static page; it's a reflection of my engineering philosophy: **Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.**

## ⚡ Key Features

- **🎨 Modern Aesthetic**: Deep space dark mode with glassmorphism effects and aurora gradients.
- **📱 True Responsiveness**: Fluid layouts that adapt seamlessly from desktops to mobile phones.
- **🚀 High Performance**: Built with semantic HTML5 and Vanilla CSS/JS for lightning-fast load times.
- **🔍 SEO Optimized**: structured data and semantic tags to ensure discoverability.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

I believe in choosing the right tool for the job. For this portfolio, I stripped away the complexity of React/Angular to focus on raw web fundamentals:

| Tech | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Semantic structure & Accessibility |
| **CSS3** | Flexbox, Grid, Custom Variables, & Animations |
| **JavaScript** | DOM Manipulation & Interactive Elements |
| **Git/GitHub** | Version Control & CI/CD via GitHub Pages |
